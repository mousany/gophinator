Gophinator is a minimal container runtime written in Go. It's a Go rewrite of 
[Writing a container in Rust](https://litchipi.site/post/911064764032430296), 
which itself is a Rust rewrite of [Linux containers in 500 lines of code](https://blog.lizzie.io/linux-containers-in-500-loc.html). This project additionally implements io redirection and tty support compared to the original implementation.

The word "Gophinator" comes from a kind of trap used to catch gophers. It's a pun on the word "container" and the Go mascot, the gopher. Have fun!
